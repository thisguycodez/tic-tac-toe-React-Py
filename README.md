TIC-TAC-TOE GAME I MADE WITH REACT,CSS,SASS,PYTHON,& SQLITE3 [SEE APP](https://thisguycodez.github.io/tic-tac-toe-React-Py/).

**Note: THE PYTHON BE IS HOSTED ON ANOTHER PLATFORM BUT I ADDED THAT DIRECTORY HERE AS WELL IN MASTER, AND ALL ITS DOING IS STARTING ALL THE NEW GAME ACCOUNTS AND SAVING ON EVERY WIN OR LOST. JAVASCRIPT IS DOING MOST THE GAME MOTIONS AND QUICK SAVING.**
